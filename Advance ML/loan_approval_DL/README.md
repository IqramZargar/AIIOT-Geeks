📌 Loan Approval Prediction Using Deep Learning (TensorFlow)
📖 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether a loan application should be approved or rejected using Deep Learning (Neural Networks) with TensorFlow/Keras.

The project is an extension of a previous Machine Learning based Loan Approval project. Here, the same problem is solved using Deep Learning techniques along with advanced evaluation methods.

🎯 Objective

The main goal of this project is to:

Understand fundamentals of Deep Learning

Implement a Neural Network for classification

Compare Deep Learning workflow with traditional Machine Learning

Learn advanced model evaluation techniques

🧠 Problem Statement

Financial institutions need to decide whether a loan applicant is eligible for loan approval based on various factors such as:

Applicant income

Credit history

Loan amount

Employment status

Property area

Education

Dependents

The model predicts:

Loan Status → Approved (Yes) or Rejected (No)

🔍 Why Deep Learning?

Traditional Machine Learning models work well for structured data, but Deep Learning helps in:

Learning complex feature relationships

Automatic feature extraction

Understanding neural network based modeling

Exposure to industry-level AI workflows

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

Scikit-learn

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

Check missing values and data types

2️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values

Convert categorical features into numeric format

Separate features and target variable

Feature scaling using StandardScaler

3️⃣ Train-Test Split

Dataset is divided into:

Training Data → Used for model learning

Testing Data → Used for performance evaluation

4️⃣ Neural Network Model Building

A Sequential Neural Network is created using TensorFlow/Keras:

Input Layer

Hidden Layers (ReLU Activation)

Output Layer (Sigmoid Activation)

5️⃣ Model Training

Model learns using:

Binary Cross Entropy Loss

Adam Optimizer

Multiple training epochs

6️⃣ Model Evaluation

The model is evaluated using:

✅ Confusion Matrix

Shows classification errors and correct predictions.

✅ Classification Report

Provides:

Precision

Recall

F1 Score

✅ ROC Curve & AUC Score

Evaluates classification performance across thresholds.

✅ Cross Validation

Ensures model reliability across different data splits.

📊 Output

The model predicts whether a loan should be:

1 → Approved
0 → Rejected
